- The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is a software design principle that states that a class or module should have only one reason to change. 
- It means that a class should have a single responsibility or a single task it is responsible for, and that responsibility should be encapsulated within that class.
- This principle helps to improve code organization, maintainability, and reusability.
# 
- The examples demonstrating how the Single Responsibility Principle can be applied in Python, Java, and C++
    - In the Employee class is only responsible for calculating the salary, and the EmployeeDatabase class is responsible for saving employee data. Each class has a single            responsibility, making the code more maintainable and flexible.
